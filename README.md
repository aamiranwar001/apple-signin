Many apps currently let you use your existing Google, Facebook, Twitter or other accounts to create a new account. In a nutshell, Sign in with Apple is an alternative to third-party sign-in services. You’ll use your Apple ID to create a new user account on a third-party app, website or platform. Once you do, you can sign in seamlessly using a single account instead of having multiple logins on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.


Advantages : 

- Apple will allow you to actually hide your email from those third-party apps, using a randomly generated and easily deletable proxy email.
- Like other sign-in services, the system also saves you from needing to remember, generate and track passwords.
- It also encourages good cybersecurity habits, since it requires that 2FA is enabled on your accounts.

Disadvantages :

Sign in with Apple requires that you create new accounts for the services you already use.
